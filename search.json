Most often, not a suggested approach.\nReplacing missing values with mean or median, i.e., P50 (for continuous data) - Effect of outliers will can play a role in replacing with mean. Replacing the values with median, is a good option.\nReplacing missing values with mode (for categorical) - This is only for categorical , and may or may not work depending on the dataset you‚Äôre dealing with. This completely ignores the affect of features (i.e., feature importance and tree interpretation) have on the target variables.\nReplacing missing values using KNN model - The k nearest neighbor algorithm is often used to impute a missing value based on how closely it resembles the points in the training set.

    "text": "Notice any Discrepancies ??\nAs observed above, you might have noticed that the S.D for our pure function and numpy function gave a result of 9.34, however for the statistics and pandas in-built function, the result is 9.85. The reason for the difference is the denominator of the Standard Deviation formula. The reason is because statistics and pandas calculate the S.D. based on the sampling distribution and not the population distribution. The Sample Stansard Deviation has N-1 as denominator in it‚Äôs formula, while the population SD formula has N.\nPopulation Standard Deviation \\[\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \\mu)^2}\\]\nSample Standard Deviation \\[s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}\\]\nSince, we don‚Äôt normally know the population mean, we have to use sample mean to calculate variance, and this introduces bias. We estimate the population variance (\\(\\sigma¬≤\\)) based on the sample standard deviation (s¬≤). Let Mean for sample be \\(\\bar{x}\\) and population mean be ≈≥. Data points \\(x1, x2..xi\\) will be more closer to \\(\\bar{x}\\) than to ≈≥.\nThis makes \\(\\sum(xi-\\bar{x})¬≤\\) to be smaller than \\(\\sum(x_i-≈≥)¬≤\\) (Numerator of the formula). To compensate for this loss, the formula has a division of N-1 instead of just N when estimating variance.\nThis is based on the concept of degrees of freedom (df). It represents the number of independent pieces of information available for estimating the population standard deviation when calculating the sample standard deviation. It is ‚Äún - 1‚Äù for a sample of size ‚Äún.‚Äù"

The target variable is a continuous column containing transaction values.\nTest data is ~11 times larger as compared to training data.\nThe dataset is hugely sparse. For multitude of columns, value for Q3 (75th Percentile) is 0.\nThe first column of data is ID field, and is highly unlikely to contribute to data modelling, as this is a primary key of the data and is unique for each rows.\nThe number of columns in training dataset is &gt; the number of rows in the training data. This is unusual behaviour.\nTraining data contains dtypes: float64(1845), int64(3147), object(1) and test data contains dtypes: float64(4991), object(1)\nThe columns are obfuscated, i.e., not human readable. To keep data confidential adhering to customer trust and legal obligations, companies tend to obfuscate data. This makes it relatively tough to extract human readable meaningful observation out of the features."

    "section": "Fitting a Simple Function to Data",
    "text": "Fitting a Simple Function to Data\nA neural network is just a mathematical function. In the most standard kind of neural network, the function:\n\nMultiplies each input by a number of values. These values are known as parameters\nAdds them up for each group of values\nReplaces the negative numbers with zeros (ReLU Activation ‚Äì to be explained later)\n\nThis represents one ‚Äúlayer‚Äù. Then these three steps are iterated, using the outputs of the previous layer as the inputs to the subsequent layer. Initially, the parameters in this function are selected at random. Therefore a newly created neural network doesn‚Äôt do anything useful at all ‚Äì it‚Äôs just random!\nTo get the function to ‚Äúlearn‚Äù to do something useful, we have to change the parameters to make them ‚Äúbetter‚Äù in some way. We do this using gradient descent. Let‚Äôs see how this works‚Ä¶\nWe will start with fitting a quadratic equation(function) to some datapoints that we will generate randomnly..\n\nThe Simple Function ‚Ä¶ Quadratic\n\ndef f(x):\n    return 5*x**2 + 4*x + 3\n\nplot_function(f=f, title=\"Function - $5x^2 + 4x + 3\", color='b')\n\n\n\n\nHere 5, 4 and 3 are the parameters or coeffecients for the quadratic function. So, a function \\(ax^4 + bx^3 + .. + e\\) has a,b,..e as the parameters . All things will get cleared out in sometime. For now, let‚Äôs create a python function which takes in parameters and returns value of the function f(x).\n\ndef func_quadratic(a, b, c, x):\n    return a*x**2 + b*x + c\n\n# Example\nfunc_quadratic(3,4,5,2.5)\n\n33.75\n\n\n\nFix Parameters using Partial\nIf we fix some particular values of a, b, and c, then we‚Äôll have made a quadratic. To fix values passed to a function in python, we use the partial function. So, what happens is, you fix the values of a,b and c to pass to the function func_quadratic and assign it to a variable say f. We can then call f with whatever values we want to pass to x. Refer below:\n\ndef mk_quad(a, b, c):\n    return partial(func_quadratic, a, b, c)\n\n\nf = mk_quad(3,4,5) # Pass values of a,b,c\nf(2.5) # Pass value of x\n\n33.75\n\n\n\nplot_function(f)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd Noise to random data\nWe now try to simulate making some noisy data for our quadratic function f. We can then use gradient descent to see if we can recreate the original function from the data.\n\nfrom numpy.random import normal, seed, uniform\n\ndef noise(x, scale): return normal(scale=scale, size=x.shape)\ndef add_noise(x, multiplier, add): return x * (1+noise(x,multiplier)) + noise(x,add)\n\n\nUsed normal distributed random numbers to generate noise\nUsed a custom function to add noise using multiplier and add argument\n\n\nseed(42)\n\nx = torch.linspace(start=-2, end=2, steps=20)\ny = add_noise(f(x), 0.4, 1.5)\n\n\nx[:5], y[:5]\n\n(tensor([-2.0000, -1.7895, -1.5789, -1.3684, -1.1579]),\n tensor([12.9866,  6.6981,  7.8615,  6.1407,  3.1628], dtype=torch.float64))\n\n\nAs visible, they‚Äôre tensors. A tensor is just like an array in numpy. A tensor can be a single number (a scalar or rank-0 tensor), a list of numbers (a vector or rank-1 tensor), a table of numbers (a matrix or rank-2 tensor), a table of tables of numbers (a rank-3 tensor), and so forth.\nWe‚Äôre not going to learn much about our data by just looking at the raw numbers, so let‚Äôs draw a picture:\n\nplt.scatter(x,y)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nNow, let‚Äôs try to use some cool python interactive functions to fit values of a,b and c to fit a line to the datapoints.\n\n\nFit the data interactively\n\n@interact(a=1.1, b=1.1, c=1.1)\ndef plot_quad(a, b, c):\n    plt.scatter(x,y)\n    plot_function(mk_quad(a,b,c), ylim=(-3,13))\n\n\n\n\nNow we can try on tweaking a, b,& c but this is a tedious task, maybe fun, lol. We defintely would have more than 3 parameters (or coeff) in a real world data and it‚Äôs gonna take a lot of time. So, we use Gradient descent to achieve the same. Before creating our gradient descent algorithm, it is notable that one thing that‚Äôs making this tricky is that we don‚Äôt really have a great sense of whether our fit is really better or worse. It would be easier if we had a numeric measure of that. On easy metric we could use is mean absolute error ‚Äì which is the distance from each data point to the curve: Solet‚Äôs define a loss function, which would be MSE (Mean Squared Error) in this case.\n\ndef mae(preds, acts):\n    return (torch.abs(preds-acts)).mean()\n\n\n@interact(a=1.1, b=1.1, c=1.1)\ndef plot_quad(a, b, c):\n    f = mk_quad(a,b,c)\n    plt.scatter(x,y)\n    loss = mae(f(x), y)\n    plot_function(f, ylim=(-3,12), title=f\"MAE: {loss:.2f}\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gradient Descent Process Automation\nWe can use calculus to figure out, for each parameter, whether we should increase or decrease it. For this part, we just need derivatives (and not the might wrathy Integration!!). Derivative measures the rate of change of a function. We don‚Äôt even need to calculate them ourselves, because the computer will do it for us! An awesome calculus resource: videos by Professor Dave.\n\nThe Basic Idea\nIf we know the gradient of our mae() function with respect to our parameters, a, b, and c, then we know how adjusting (for instance) a will change the value of mae(). If, say, a has a negative gradient, then we know that increasing a will decrease mae(). Then we know that‚Äôs what we need to do, since we trying to make mae() as low as possible.\nSo, we find the gradient of mae() for each of our parameters, and then adjust our parameters a bit in the opposite direction to the sign of the gradient.\nTo do this, first we need a function that takes all the parameters a, b, and c as a single vector input, and returns the value mae() based on those parameters:\n\ndef quad_mae(params):\n    f = mk_quad(*params)\n    return mae(f(x), y)\n\n\nquad_mae([1.1, 1.1, 1.1])\n\ntensor(4.6392, dtype=torch.float64)\n\n\n\nThis is the original MAE without any gradient descent performed."

    "text": "Doing it from Scratch\nLet‚Äôs create a randomly initialized parameters with no meaning whatsoever, and store it as a rank-1 tensor.\n\nabc = torch.tensor([1.1,1.2,1.3])\nabc\n\ntensor([1.1000, 1.2000, 1.3000])\n\n\nOur objective is to calculate the gradient, and update the parameters in the direction opposite to the gradient. There‚Äôs a very handy way in pytorch to fetch the gradient. We can just simply use requires_grad_() for the tensor to give a heads up! Hey tensor, we will be needing gradient soon :)\n\nabc.requires_grad_()\n\ntensor([1.1000, 1.2000, 1.3000], requires_grad=True)\n\n\nLet‚Äôs now calculate the loss for the provided parameters through our function defined before.\n\nloss = quad_mae(abc)\nloss\n\ntensor(4.4666, dtype=torch.float64, grad_fn=&lt;MeanBackward0&gt;)\n\n\nHey Pytorch‚Ä¶Now go ahead and do the calculation for me to compute the gradient !\n\nloss.backward()\n\nThe above command adds an attribute called grad which gives the gradient.\n\nabc.grad\n\ntensor([-1.4194,  0.0737, -0.9000])\n\n\n\nWhat does the above grad mean ?\nIt simply means.. (1) if I increase a, loss will go down; (2) if I increase b, loss will go up, (3) if I increase c, loss will go down but very less.\nSo, now let‚Äôs increase a, then increase c and then decrease b.\nBut how do we do that ? Turns out, the idea is rather simple! If we subtract the gradient, multiplied by a small number, that should improve the outcome and decrease the loss by a bit.\n\n'''\nWe are updating the parameters by subtracting the gradient times a small number from initial params\n'''\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    abc -= abc.grad*0.01\n    loss = quad_mae(abc)\n    \nprint(f'loss = {loss:0.3f}')\n\nloss = 4.438\n\n\nAs you can see, the loss has decreased by a very slight amount, i.e., from 4.4666 to 4.438\nAlso, the interesting code of line with torch.no_grad(): ‚Ä¶ what is it ?\nSo, abc.requires_grad_() means, we are instructing pytorch to use the gradient of abc when used in a function ahead. However, in the above code, we don‚Äôt really want it‚Äôs gradient only. We are updating the parameters here, and hence the above line of code indicates, that don‚Äôt use the gradient of abc inside that context manager unless specificallly asked using abc.grad. BAM!!!\nThe ‚Äúsmall number‚Äù we multiply is called the learning rate, and is one of the most important hyper-parameter to set when training a neural network.\nBTW, you‚Äôll see we had to wrap our calculation of the new parameters in with torch.no_grad(). That disables the calculation of gradients for any operations inside that context manager. We have to do that, because abc -= abc.grad*0.01 isn‚Äôt actually part of our quadratic model, so we don‚Äôt want derivitives to include that calculation.\nWe can use a loop to do a few more iterations of this:\n\nfor i in range(8):\n    loss = quad_mae(abc)\n    loss.backward()\n    with torch.no_grad(): abc -= abc.grad*0.01\n    print(f'step={i}; loss={loss:.2f}')\n\nstep=0; loss=4.44\nstep=1; loss=4.38\nstep=2; loss=4.30\nstep=3; loss=4.18\nstep=4; loss=4.04\nstep=5; loss=3.87\nstep=6; loss=3.67\nstep=7; loss=3.45\n\n\n\nabc\n\ntensor([1.7387, 1.1668, 1.7050], requires_grad=True)\n\n\nIf we keep running this loop for looooong time we‚Äôll observe that the loss eventually starts increasing for a while. That‚Äôs because once the parameters get close to the correct answer, our parameter updates will jump right over the correct answer! To avoid this, we need to decrease our learning rate as we train. This is done using a learning rate schedule, and can be automated in most deep learning frameworks, such as PyTorch."

    "text": "But wait.. this doesn‚Äôt look powerful enough! Let‚Äôs introduce activation Function\nNeural network is a very expressive function! It‚Äôs poweful and convenient and gets your job done! In fact ‚Äì it‚Äôs infinitely expressive. A neural network can approximate any computable function, given enough parameters. A ‚Äúcomputable function‚Äù can cover just about anything you can imagine: understand and translate human speech; paint a picture; diagnose a disease from medical imaging; write an essay; etc‚Ä¶\n\nBut how does a neural network approximates a function ?\nThe fundamental steps include (but are not limited to):\n\nMatrix multiplication, which is in layman terms multiplying numbers together and then adding them up\nThe function \\(max(x,0)\\), which replaces all negative numbers with zero.\n\nThe combination of a linear function and this max() is called a rectified linear function (ReLU), and it can be implemented like this:\n\ndef rectified_linear(m,b,x):\n    y = m*x+b\n    return torch.clip(y, 0.)\n\n\nThe linear function above is \\(y=m*x+b\\)\nIn PyTorch, the function \\(max(x,0)\\) is written as torch.clip(x,0).\n\n\nf = partial(rectified_linear, 1, 1) # PRoviding *m* and *b*\nplot_function(f, title = 'Simple ReLU graph', color = 'g')\n\n\n\n\nLet‚Äôs interact the above function\n\n@interact(m=1, b=2)\ndef plot_relu(m, b):\n    plot_function(partial(rectified_linear, m, b), title='Interactive ReLU', min = -5, color = 'b')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReLU\n\n\n\n\nBut why is it interesting ?\nIt‚Äôs not!! It isn‚Äôt interesting or poweful on it‚Äôs own. However, it is awesomly flexibile when we add another layer of ReLU to this graph. Let‚Äôs see how..\n\ndef double_relu(m1, b1, m2, b2, x):\n    return rectified_linear(m1, b1, x) + rectified_linear(m2, b2, x)\n\n@interact(m1=-1.5, b1=-2.0, m2=1.5, b2=1.7)\ndef plot_double_relu(m1, b1, m2, b2):\n    plot_function(partial(double_relu, m1,b1,m2,b2), color = 'b', min = -5, ylim=(-1,6))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble ReLU\n\n\nLet‚Äôs another layer of ReLU and observe..!\n\ndef triple_relu(m1, b1, m2, b2, m3, b3, x):\n    return rectified_linear(m1, b1, x) + rectified_linear(m2, b2, x) + rectified_linear(m3, b3, x)\n\n@interact(m1=-1.5, b1=-2.0, m2=1.5, b2=1.7, m3=-1.1, b3=2.0)\ndef triple_relu(m1, b1, m2, b2, m3, b3):\n    plot_function(partial(triple_relu, m1,b1,m2,b2,m3,b3), color = 'b', min = -5, ylim=(-1,10))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTriple ReLU\n\n\nSo, we can add as many ReLUs as we want and fit the function as close as we want. Hence, Neural networks are infinitely flexibile functions and can approximate to any input as we like!!\n\nWUHOOO!! CONGRATULATIONS‚Ä¶ WE HAVE JUST DERIVED THE VERY FOUNDATION OF DEEP LEARNINGg"

There is no one definitive answer that is universally accepted, as the understanding of god can vary depending on individual beliefs, cultural context, and religious tradition. Here are some common interpretations and perspectives on the meaning of god:\n\nTranscendent Being: In many religious traditions, god is conceived as a transcendent being who exists beyond the physical universe and is responsible for its creation and maintenance. This being is often characterized as all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-loving.\nImmanent Presence: Some spiritual and philosophical traditions view god as an immanent presence that is inherent in all things. This perspective emphasizes the interconnectedness of all living beings and the sacredness of the natural world.\nPersonal Deity: In theistic religions, god is often perceived as a personal deity who can be engaged with through prayer, worship, and ritual. This personal god may be seen as a source of comfort, guidance, and moral authority.\nSymbol or Metaphor: For some individuals, god may be understood as a symbol or metaphor that represents the ultimate reality or the highest ideals and values in life. This interpretation allows for a more abstract and flexible understanding of god that is not necessarily tied to a specific belief system.\nNon-Theistic Perspectives: In non-theistic traditions, such as Buddhism and Taoism, the concept of god may not be central or even present. Instead, these traditions emphasize the cultivation of wisdom, compassion, and ethical conduct as the path to spiritual fulfillment.\nCultural and Historical Influences: The understanding of god is often shaped by cultural and historical factors. Different societies and epochs have developed their own unique interpretations and representations of god, influenced by their mythology, traditions, and social structures.\nPersonal Experience: For many individuals, the meaning of god is deeply rooted in personal experiences, such as moments of awe, gratitude, or connection with the natural world. These experiences can shape an individual‚Äôs understanding of god and their relationship to the divine.\n\nUltimately, the meaning of god is a highly personal and subjective matter, and there is no single interpretation that can fully encompass the diverse and evolving nature of human religious thought and experience.\n\n\n\n\nPersonality prompt - general questioning\nConversation with user\npersonality prompt - user based\n\n\nchat = model.start_chat(history=[])\nchat\n\n&lt;google.generativeai.generative_models.ChatSession at 0x1078e2f90&gt;\n\n\n\nresponse = chat.send_message(\"In one sentence, explain how there is only one god.\")\nto_markdown(response.text)\n\n\nThe oneness of God is a fundamental belief in many religions and spiritual traditions, asserting that there is only one supreme being responsible for the creation and governance of the universe.\n\n\n\n\nresponse = chat.send_message(\"Okay, how about a bit more detailed explanation to a high schooler?\", stream=True)\n\nfor chunk in response:\n  print(chunk.text)\n  print(\"_\"*80)\n\nIn many religions and spiritual traditions, the concept of monotheism, or belief\n________________________________________________________________________________\n in one God, is central. This means that there is only one supreme being who created and governs the universe. This belief contrasts with polytheism, which\n________________________________________________________________________________\n is the belief in multiple gods.\n\nOne way to understand the oneness of God is to think about the universe as a vast and complex system. Just as a complex machine needs a single engineer or designer, the universe, with its intricate laws and interconnectedness, is often seen as evidence of a single creator.\n\nAdditionally\n________________________________________________________________________________\n, many religious traditions teach that God is all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-present.

This belief contrasts with polytheism, which is the belief in multiple gods.\nOne way to understand the oneness of God is to think about the universe as a vast and complex system. Just as a complex machine needs a single engineer or designer, the universe, with its intricate laws and interconnectedness, is often seen as evidence of a single creator.\nAdditionally, many religious traditions teach that God is all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-present. These attributes suggest that there can only be one God, as there cannot be multiple beings with these infinite qualities.\nThe oneness of God is a fundamental tenet of many faiths and provides a framework for understanding the relationship between humanity and the divine.\n\n\n\n\nresponse.prompt_feedback\n\nsafety_ratings {\n  category: HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT\n  probability: NEGLIGIBLE\n}\nsafety_ratings {\n  category: HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH\n  probability: NEGLIGIBLE\n}\nsafety_ratings {\n  category: HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT\n  probability: NEGLIGIBLE\n}\nsafety_ratings {\n  category: HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT\n  probability: NEGLIGIBLE\n}\n\n\n\nPrompt Design 1\n\ndef make_prompt():\n#   escaped = relevant_passage.replace(\"'\", \"\").replace('\"', \"\").replace(\"\\n\", \" \")\n  prompt = textwrap.dedent(\"\"\"You are a very human friendly bot that asks question to a human for introding them.

    "text": "What are Pixels ?\nPixel is the smallest fragment of an image.\n\n\nWhat are Channel ?\n\n1 channel - shows black and white or greyscale images\nRed-Green-Blue channels - shows colored images\n\n\n\nWhat are Pixel Size ?\nEvery pixel can store 8 bits of memory, for e.g.¬†So, the range of values it can store is 2^8=256, i.e., between 0 to 255. Where 255 represents white shade, and 0 represents black shade. Numbers between 0 & 255 are different shades of black and white ‚ÄúOR‚Äù grey\n\n\nWhat are filters ?\nFilters are a way to alter the original image. Filters are smaller matrix that are multiplied with larger matrix in a left to right fashion (like a torch), for e.g., to result in a different matrix. The resultant matrix will have different pixel values at certain places which will result in altering the source image. This can be inferred as a small convolution operation. They are also termed as Kernels\n\n\nStandard type of filters ?\n\nHigh-Pass filters: Used for sharpening the image.\nLow-Pass filters: Used for smoothening the image.\n\nThese filters can help in detecting edges or differentiate between brightness.\n\nExample functioning of Filters\n\n\nShow the code\nimport numpy as np\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom scipy.ndimage import convolve\nfrom matplotlib.pyplot import imread\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\npath = \"/Users/kashmkj/fastai_repo_22/kashish18.github.io/\"\n\nimage_profile = imread(path+\"/profile.jpg\")\n\nplt.imshow(image_profile)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nEdge = np.array(\n    [[0,1,0],\n     [1,-8,1],\n     [0,1,0]], dtype=np.float64) # Filter Matrix\n\nImage_channel = []\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\n# We have 3 channels since it's a colored image, hence we loop over 3 times.\n# convolve(array_input, filter) will do the convolution operation, i.e., \n# multiply input image for each channel with the filter matrix\nfor channel in range(3):\n    res = convolve(image_profile[:,:,channel], Edge)\n    Image_channel.append(res)\n\nimg = np.dstack((Image_channel[0], Image_channel[1], Image_channel[2]))\nplt.imshow(img)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nprint(\"Shape of output image = \" + str(img.shape))\n\nprint(\"Shape of input image = \" + str(image_profile.shape))\n    \nprint(\"Length of Image channel = \" + str(len(Image_channel)))\n\nprint(\"Shape of each Image Channel = \" + str(Image_channel[0].shape))\n\n\nShape of output image = (960, 640, 3)\nShape of input image = (960, 640, 3)\nLength of Image channel = 3\nShape of each Image Channel = (960, 640)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich library can we use to get different type of filters ?\nThere are some in built filters present in PIL library :-\nfrom PIL import Image, ImageFilter\nfrom PIL.ImageFilter import (BLUR, CONTOUR, EDGE_ENHANCE...)\n\n\nWhy the concept of convolution ?\nThere are mainly two reasons why convolution is required instead of having just a simple feed forward NN: 1. Humongous number of input parameters (i.e, pixel size) 2. Exploit the spacial correlation across pixels resulting in reducing in number of operations for NN.\n\n\nWhat is a basic convolution ?\nA snapshot of input matrix (For E.g., 3 * 3) is convolved with a filter matrix (also 3 * 3), also called Weights. The actual input image can be of size say 10 * 10. The filter matrix will swipe through the entire input matrix taking a snapshot of 3 * 3 (just like how a torch moves from left to right and top to bottom). The resultant matrix is a colnvoluted matrix. ‚ÄúColvolved‚Äù involes summation of dot product of two matrices. Convolution helps extracting characteristics in an image. It also helps to reduce computation because at every convolution operation, we are reducing the dimension of the image which will be eventually given as input to the neural network classifier.\n\n\nWhat is a convolutional Neural netowork ?\nConvolution combined with a feed forward network is called CNN. We applied convolution to N * M matrix.\nThen we flatten the image to 1D( 1 * ( N * M ) ) and apply the normal feed forward neural network.\n\n\nWhat is Padding ?\nAdding additional rows/columns to the image arrays. This is usually done symmetrically. Zero-padding means adding Zeroes (i.e., black) pixels to the boundary of images.\n\nThis can be sometimes required when you don‚Äôt want to reduce the size of the output matrix once the filter is applied. For E.g., Input 100 * 100 matrix is multipled by 3 * 3 filter -&gt; Resultant is 98 * 98 matrix. But if you want to keep the input image intact, you can add padding to the input image to make it 102 * 102.\nThis is also useful to provide all pixels equal importance, mainly the Edges of the image which are only multiplied with the filter twice, as compared to the inner regions which are multiplied three or more times.\n\n\n\nWhat is Stride ?\nStride is a parameter of the neural network‚Äôs filter that modifies the amount of movement over the image. Stride of 2 means the filter moves two pixels ahead, that is, 1 pixel is ignored. Stride of 1 is the default movement for filter, in which case no pixel is ignored.\n\n\n\nStride\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Pooling ?\nAlso type of sub-sampling, used to reduce the size of input image in multiplicative way. Max, Average and Min Pooling are two common type of pooling. In MaxPooling, the maximum value of the resultant 3 * 3 snapshot will be taken as the output pixel for that area.\n\n\nWhat is a feature map ?\nOutput of the convolution after doing all the operations like pooling, stride, padding, is called a feature map. This feature map is passed through an activation function like ReLU, and called an activation map.\n\n\nWhat is inside a single convolution layer ?\n\nImage (RGB channels) is multiplied with (2) Kernel/Filters to produce a (3) convoluted matrix, also called feature map. This matrix is passed (4) to an activation function like ReLU to create an activation map, and (5) Pooling is applied on the resultant matrix. This new feature map will be input to the 2nd convolution layer.\n\nOnce the image has gone through N Convolution layers, it is flattened to feed into the fully connected neural network, which will then perform classification. Here, the learnable parameters weights are Filters. So, the filter weights are updated during backpropagation.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "section": "",
    "text": "KPI.jpg\n\n\n\nGentle Introduction\nBusiness Intelligence (BI) is a field that plays a pivotal role in helping organizations make data-driven decisions. Business Intelligence involves the process of collecting, analyzing, and transforming raw data into meaningful insights that can be used by businesses to make informed decisions. Now, for someone who is reading this blog, I am pretty confident that you arrived here in order to understand the intelligent terms I‚Äôm referring. Well, for any Business Analyst or Business Intelligence Engineer, here I‚Äôll be describing about various jargons used in the industry and what each of these mean in detail. This will be done on a few blog series. Under each blog, I will focus on 1 business and 1 technical jargon.\nAlso, comment down below if you know why I chose to write 1 business and 1 technical terms as part of the blog.\n\n\nKPI\nI wouldn‚Äôt be doing justice to the article and the Analysts here, if I don‚Äôt commence with possibly the most fundamental terminology in the BI community, viz., KPI.\nKPI stands for Key Performance Indicators. Well, as the phrase suggests, these are the indicators which directly assess the business objective. KPI help businesses measure their success of failure in achieving their objectives. Some key characteristics for KPIs include:\n\nQuantifiable: KPIs are quantifiable measures that reflect the performance of an organization, department, team, or individual in relation to their goals and objectives.\nTimeliness: KPIs should provide information in a timely manner, allowing for timely interventions or adjustments.\nConsistency: KPIs should be consistent over time and comparable across different periods. Why not, If you can‚Äôt compare over time, how would they lead to actions!\n\nActionability: KPIs should provide insights that can lead to actionable decisions and improvements.\n\nThese can be high-level at a company‚Äôs stand point of view, or lower level at various departments level. Let‚Äôs consider a scenario where you‚Äôre running an online clothing brand company with your in-house application. You‚Äôre the Executive of the company and you have Directors reporting to you for various departments such as Sales, Logistics and Software. At the C-Suite level, we can define the following KPIs:\n[Universe]\nWAIT BOOMER!!! How can you define KPI just like that ?? Don‚Äôt you wanna define your business objective first ?\n[Author]\nOhhh I forgot about that part! Forgive me Universe!\n[Universe]\nForgiven! But don‚Äôt you dare forget such primer details in your blog!\n[The Author Continues]‚Ä¶\nSo let‚Äôs brainstorm on what the Executive would care about. You can stop for a bit, think and maybe then come again to check how many of the goals intersected. For me, If I were the C-suite leve, I would want to know the following information:\n\nHow much revenue has my company generated this month Vs the other months?\nHow has the new feature launch impacted our sales?\nHow has our application performed? (There can be various aspects to consider such as latency, click through rate, recommendation engine‚Äôs performance, etc.)\nWhat has been the in-stock and out-stock trend for the past year?\nWhich marketing strategy impacted our sales by the highest percentage?\n\nWhile the above are not the only goals, but these are definitely the ones I would be interested. Once, you have got your goals established, let‚Äôs proceed towards creating KPIs and metrics for each of the goals:\n\nHow much revenue has my company generated ?\nKPIs: - Monthly Gross Revenue trend (growth or fall)\nMetrics: 1. Monthly Sales Revenue 2. Average Order Value 3. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) - Calculated using RMF score - Recency, Frequency and Monetary. 4. Conversion rate (percentage of visitors who make a purchase)\n\n\nHow has our application performed?\nKPIs: - Application conversion Rate\nMetrics: - Application Load time or latency spikes - Application Vs Website Traffic share - Mobile Cart Abandonment Rate\n\n\nHow has the new feature launch impacted our sales?\nKPIs: - Feature-Driven Sales Growth Rate : Percentage Increase in Sales Attributable to the New Feature\nMetrics: - Sales conversion rate (Conversion rate of users who engaged with the new feature compared to those who did not) - New Feature Adoption Rate (Percentage of customers who have used the new feature) - Churn Rate (Reduction in customer churn rate after the feature launch)\nYou can perform your own practise now to define various Goals, KPI and metrics for your business use-case!!\n\n\n\nData Silo\nImagine you‚Äôre a big company consisting of different departments namely Sales, Finance and Software. Each of your department contains plethora of data concerning their respective departments. For E.g., Sales department might have number of purchases made per week, amount of units sold, profits or losses incurred, etc. This data kind is very different when we compare data from Software department which can be: latency observed per week, percentage increase in API hits, etc. Hence, it makes logical sense that the data for each of these departments is stored in a isolated systems, albiet it also would lead to data redundancy as multiple departments (Such as Sales and Marketing) may store similar or identical data independently. The Data Silo scenario happens all the time in the industry. Here are a few characteristics of Data Silo scenario:\n\nData Redundancy: Data duplication can occur as a result of data silos. Multiple departments may store similar or identical data independently, leading to inefficiencies and potential data inconsistencies.\nLimited Data Sharing: Data sets are isolated and not easily accessible or visible to other parts of the organization. This lack of data sharing can hinder collaboration and decision-making.\nInefficient Processes: Data silos can lead to redundant processes. For instance, if different departments maintain their customer data separately, it may require duplication of efforts when it comes to customer interactions and analysis.\nBarriers to Insights: Business Intelligence and Data Science rely on the availability of comprehensive and integrated data. Data silos can be a significant barrier to gaining holistic insights from an organization‚Äôs data.\nCompliance and Security Risks: Data silos can also raise security and compliance concerns, as different data repositories may have varying levels of access controls and security measures.\n\nThere are various methodologies to tackle the Data Silo effects such as 1. Data Integration (through ETL - Extract Transform and Load processes); 2. Data warehousing; 3. Building API (Application Program Interfaces) and data connectors to create connections between disparate systems and enable real or near real time data sharing ‚Ä¶ and so on.\nThe details of these are out of scope of this current article.\n\n\nNext Up\nI would end part 1 of the series here! Coming up next are 2 more important concepts viz., Data Dashboard and Data Warehouse.\nStay Tuned.. Until then!\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "BMI and New BMI Calculation and Analysis\nWe now move forward to leverage the parameters, weight and height for each individuals to calculate their Body Mass Index. I referred the below formulas based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index to calculate BMI respectively.\n\nBody Mass Index (BMI): The BMI is calculated using the following formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{BMI} = \\frac{\\text{weight}}{\\text{height}^2} \\]\nWhere:\n\n( weight ) is the weight of the individual in kilograms.\n( height ) is the height of the individual in meters.\n\n\nNew BMI: The New BMI is calculated by taking the exponent of 2.5 of the BMI value. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{New BMI} = \\frac{\\text{weight}*1.3}{\\text{height}^{2.5}} \\]\nThese formulas are commonly used to assess an individual‚Äôs body composition and health status based on their weight and height measurements.\n\n# Calculate BMI and New BMI for each person\nbmis = []\nnew_bmis = []\n\nfor i in range(len(names)):\n    height_meters = heights[i] / 100  # convert height to meters\n    bmi = weights[i] / (height_meters ** 2)\n    new_bmi = 1.3* weights[i] / (height_meters ** 2.5)\n    \n    bmis.append(bmi)\n    new_bmis.append(new_bmi)\n\n# Print BMI and New BMI values\nfor i in range(len(names)):\n    print(f\"{names[i]}'s BMI is: {bmis[i]:.2f}, New BMI is: {new_bmis[i]:.2f}\")\n\nRajesh's BMI is: 25.71, New BMI is: 26.02\nPriya's BMI is: 20.76, New BMI is: 20.70\nAmit's BMI is: 26.12, New BMI is: 25.67\nSneha's BMI is: 21.48, New BMI is: 22.08\nDivya's BMI is: 23.03, New BMI is: 23.10\n\n\nThis code calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) and the New BMI for each person in the dataset. It iterates over the list of names, heights, and weights, converting heights to meters and then computing BMI using the formula weight divided by height squared. The New BMI is calculated by taking the exponent of 2.5 of the BMI value. The resulting BMI and New BMI values are stored in separate lists (bmis and new_bmis). Finally, it prints out the BMI and New BMI values for each person in the dataset with their corresponding names."

    "text": "BMI Category Visualization\nData is showcased in a better way and more understandable when represented in a form of visualisation. Hence, we write down a code to generate a bar plot representing the BMI values of individuals, with each bar color-coded according to their BMI category.\n\n# Define colors for each BMI category\ncolors = {'underweight': 'blue', 'normal': 'green', 'overweight': 'orange', 'obese': 'red'}\n\n# Create a figure and axis object\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# Plot bars for each person\nfor i in range(len(names)):\n    bmi_category = get_bmi_category(bmis[i])\n    ax.bar(names[i], bmis[i], color=colors[bmi_category])\n\n# Set labels and title\nax.set_xlabel('Names')\nax.set_ylabel('BMI')\nax.set_title('BMI Categories')\n\n# Create a custom legend\nhandles = [plt.Rectangle((0,0),1,1, color=colors[label]) for label in colors]\nlabels = colors.keys()\nax.legend(handles, labels)\n\n# Show plot\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThis above code generates a bar plot representing the BMI values of individuals, with each bar color-coded according to their BMI category. It creates a figure and axis object, plots bars for each person using their BMI values, sets labels and a title for the plot, generates a custom legend with color-coded labels for BMI categories, and finally displays the plot with rotated x-axis labels for better readability.\nIn the above exercise, we generated BMIs, New BMIS and categorised those BMIs for the list of 5 people. Let‚Äôs look at the Benefits, limitations and possible missuses of these metrics.\nBenefits of BMI and New BMI: BMI and the New BMI offer a straightforward and easily calculable measure for healthcare professionals to assess weight-related health risks quickly. They serve as valuable initial screening tools, providing insights into potential health issues such as cardiovascular disease and mortality rates. Additionally, the New BMI, with its emphasis on visceral fat through a higher exponent, attempts to refine the assessment of health risks associated with excess adiposity.\nLimitations of BMI and New BMI: However, both BMI and the New BMI have limitations that must be acknowledged. Firstly, they do not directly measure body fat percentage or distribution, which can result in misclassifications, especially for individuals with high muscle mass or dense bone structure. Additionally, BMI does not consider differences in body composition across various demographic groups, potentially leading to inaccuracies in assessing health risks.\nPossible Misuses: Moreover, the emphasis on achieving specific BMI categories can contribute to body image issues and weight stigma within society. The cultural idealization of thinness may lead to unhealthy behaviors such as disordered eating and excessive exercise in pursuit of a lower BMI. Furthermore, relying solely on BMI as a measure of health may oversimplify complex health factors and perpetuate the misconception that thinness equates to healthiness."

    "text": "Conclusion\nIn summary, this analysis provided valuable insights into the BMI distribution among friends and family, shedding light on their respective health statuses. By categorizing individuals into BMI categories and visualizing the data through a color-coded bar plot, we were able to identify trends and patterns that may inform future health interventions and lifestyle adjustments. However, it‚Äôs essential to acknowledge the limitations of BMI as a sole measure of health and to consider other factors such as body composition, diet, and physical activity levels when assessing overall well-being.\nPossible extensions of this analysis could involve incorporating additional demographic information such as age, gender, and ethnicity to examine how these factors influence BMI distribution. Moreover, longitudinal studies could be conducted to track changes in BMI over time and assess the effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving health outcomes. Furthermore, exploring the relationship between BMI and other health indicators such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and chronic disease prevalence could provide a more comprehensive understanding of individuals‚Äô health status. Overall, this analysis serves as a starting point for further research into understanding and promoting optimal health and well-being within communities."

    "text": "Introduction:\nThe Sound Stack Exchange platform serves as a hub for professionals, enthusiasts, and hobbyists interested in various aspects of sound technology, including audio production, sound design, acoustics, and music composition. In this project, we conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Sound Stack Exchange community to gain insights into user behavior, content contributions, and community dynamics. Through the analysis of diverse datasets encompassing posts, comments, user profiles, and voting activities, we aim to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations that characterize the interactions within this specialized online community.\n\nAbstract:\nOur project delves into the rich dataset extracted from Sound Stack Exchange, a dedicated platform for individuals passionate about sound technology. We begin by merging multiple datasets, including information on posts, comments, users, votes, and badges, to form a comprehensive dataset for analysis. We then employ various data visualization techniques, statistical analyses, and exploratory methods to uncover valuable insights. These insights encompass the distribution of post topics, the engagement levels of users, the influence of badges on user behavior, and the temporal dynamics of community activity. Additionally, we explore the geographical distribution of users and their contributions, shedding light on the global reach of the Sound Stack Exchange community. Through our findings, we provide a deeper understanding of the dynamics and characteristics of this online platform, contributing to the broader discourse on digital communities and knowledge-sharing networks."

    "text": "Data Analysis: Locations Insights\nSummary:\nThis section focuses on analyzing the data based on the locations provided by users. Initially, we filter the dataset to include only records with non-null location information.\nAfterwards, we convert the creation dates of various entities to datetime objects to facilitate further analysis. This step ensures consistency and avoids potential warnings.\nNext, we calculate several metrics to gain insights into the posting behavior and engagement levels of users from different locations. The metrics include: - Posts per day: Average number of posts made by users from each location per day. - Average Post Score: The average score received by posts from each location. - Average Views: The average number of views received by posts from each location.\nSubsequently, we create a summary table aggregating the calculated metrics for each unique location. This summary table provides a comprehensive overview of the posting activity and engagement levels across different locations.\nFinally, we visualize the top 20 locations with the highest number of posts using Plotly Express. This visualization helps in identifying the most active regions in terms of user contributions, facilitating further analysis and insights into regional posting trends.\n\n# data with location\n\nLocation_df = merged_df[~merged_df['Location'].isna()]\nlen(Location_df)\n\n235898\n\n\n\npd.options.mode.chained_assignment = None\n\n# Convert creation dates to datetime objects to avoid SettingWithCopyWarning\nLocation_df['CreationDate_posts'] = pd.to_datetime(Location_df['CreationDate_posts'])\nLocation_df['CreationDate_comments'] = pd.to_datetime(Location_df['CreationDate_comments'])\nLocation_df['CreationDate_post_links'] = pd.to_datetime(Location_df['CreationDate_post_links'])\nLocation_df['CreationDate_users'] = pd.to_datetime(Location_df['CreationDate_users'])\nLocation_df['CreationDate_votes'] = pd.to_datetime(Location_df['CreationDate_votes'])\n\n# Calculate the metrics\nLocation_df['Posts per Day'] = Location_df['Id_posts'] / (pd.to_datetime('today') - Location_df['CreationDate_posts']).dt.days\nLocation_df['Average PostScore'] = Location_df['Score_posts'] / Location_df['Id_posts']\nLocation_df['Average Views'] = Location_df['Views'] / Location_df['Id_posts']\n\n# Create a summary table\nlocation_summary = Location_df.groupby('Location').agg({\n    'Id_posts': 'count',\n    'OwnerUserId': 'nunique',\n    'Posts per Day': 'mean',\n    'Average PostScore': 'mean',\n    'Views': 'sum'\n}).reset_index()\n\n# Rename columns for clarity\nlocation_summary.columns = ['Location', 'Posts', 'Unique Contributors', \n                            'Avg Posts/Day', 'Avg Post Score', 'Total Views']\n\n# Display the top 20 locations by number of posts\nlocation_summary_top20 = location_summary.sort_values(by='Posts', ascending=False).head(20)\nlocation_summary_top20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation\nPosts\nUnique Contributors\nAvg Posts/Day\nAvg Post Score\nTotal Views\n\n\n\n\n186\nCalifornia\n16107\n19\n2.540462\n0.001894\n24209550.0\n\n\n553\nLondon\n11253\n38\n5.916709\n0.001239\n617825.0\n\n\n187\nCalifornia, USA\n9230\n1\n2.162928\n0.003015\n15875600.0\n\n\n755\nOrlando, Fl\n7240\n1\n0.417693\n0.020865\n5473440.0\n\n\n1053\nToronto\n5699\n6\n3.089592\n0.000879\n3235560.0\n\n\n109\nBerkeley, CA\n5395\n4\n2.333486\n0.001545\n5830905.0\n\n\n249\nDallas\n3954\n2\n2.577033\n0.001031\n1955118.0\n\n\n108\nBergen, Norway\n3855\n1\n7.220469\n0.000467\n589815.0\n\n\n567\nLos Angeles, CA\n3839\n15\n2.052593\n0.001289\n2954372.0\n\n\n1084\nUnited Kingdom\n3786\n48\n12.205236\n0.000331\n37748.0\n\n\n559\nLondon, United Kingdom\n3751\n37\n41.929947\n0.000093\n410664.0\n\n\n893\nSan Francisco Bay Area\n3339\n1\n1.169286\n0.010128\n2958354.0\n\n\n928\nSeattle, WA\n3289\n15\n6.075481\n0.000223\n194267.0\n\n\n447\nIllinois\n3107\n3\n5.285660\n0.000795\n31004.0\n\n\n614\nMelbourne, Australia\n3029\n12\n25.227580\n0.002393\n495537.0\n\n\n33\nAmsterdam, Netherlands\n2957\n8\n2.015193\n0.016708\n2550107.0\n\n\n837\nRensselaer, NY\n2915\n1\n8.431776\n0.000121\n638385.0\n\n\n346\nFrance\n2825\n22\n2.716287\n0.001992\n1196140.0\n\n\n64\nAuckland, New Zealand\n2721\n5\n1.650918\n0.001601\n803128.0\n\n\n737\nOdense, Denmark\n2639\n1\n14.429640\n0.000116\n398489.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Create a bar chart for posts by location\nfig = px.bar(\n    location_summary_top20,\n    x='Location',\n    y='Posts',\n    title='Top 20 Locations by Posts',\n    height=600,\n    category_orders={'Location': location_summary_top20['Location']},\n    text='Location',\n    color='Location'  # Change the color of bars based on location\n)\n\n# Rotate x-axis labels for better readability\nfig.update_layout(xaxis_tickangle=-45)\n\n# Show the bar chart\nfig.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\nData Visualization: Posts by Location Insights\nSummary:\nThis section presents a bar chart visualization illustrating the distribution of posts across the top 20 locations with the highest posting activity.\nUsing Plotly Express, we create a bar chart where each bar represents a specific location, and its height corresponds to the number of posts contributed from that location. The color of the bars is also determined by the location, aiding in visually distinguishing between different regions.\nTo enhance readability, we rotate the x-axis labels by -45 degrees, ensuring that location names are displayed more clearly and prevent overlap.\nThe resulting visualization provides a clear and intuitive representation of the posting activity across different locations, allowing for easy comparison and identification of the most active regions in terms of user contributions."

    "section": "Analyzing Post Frequency Over Time",
    "text": "Analyzing Post Frequency Over Time\nSummary:\nThis section explores the frequency of postings over time by analyzing the monthly post counts.\nWe begin by converting the ‚ÄòCreationDate_posts‚Äô column to datetime format and setting it as the index of the dataframe. This allows us to easily perform time-based operations.\nNext, we use the resample function to aggregate the post counts on a monthly basis. By specifying the parameter 'M', we group the data into monthly intervals.\nA line plot is then generated, where each data point represents the count of posts made in a particular month. The x-axis represents time, while the y-axis indicates the corresponding number of posts.\n\n# Checking how many postings were made over the period of time\nmerged_df['CreationDate_posts'] = pd.to_datetime(merged_df['CreationDate_posts'])\nmerged_df.set_index('CreationDate_posts', inplace=True)\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(15, 6))\nmerged_df.resample('M').size().plot(legend=False)\nplt.title('Monthly Post Count Over Time')\nplt.xlabel('Date')\nplt.ylabel('Number of Posts')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThis visualization provides insights into the posting trends over the period under analysis, highlighting any significant changes or patterns in posting activity over time.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, our exploratory data analysis of the Sound Stack Exchange community has revealed intriguing patterns and trends inherent within the platform. We have observed the dominance of certain topics, the active participation of a subset of users, and the impact of badges on incentivizing contributions. Additionally, our analysis of temporal trends and geographical distributions has provided valuable insights into the evolution and diversity of the community. By uncovering these insights, we not only enhance our understanding of the Sound Stack Exchange platform but also contribute to the broader body of knowledge on online communities and collaborative platforms. Our findings underscore the importance of data-driven approaches in elucidating the dynamics of digital communities and highlight avenues for further research and exploration in this domain."

    "text": "Introduction\nIn this report, we analyze weather data from three major airports in the New York City area (LGA, JFK, and EWR) to determine monthly mean wind speeds and identify any outliers.\nThis report presents an analysis of monthly mean wind speeds at LGA, JFK, and EWR airports using historical weather data. The data is fetched from nycflights13_weather.csv file present publically on the internet. 1. We start with importing the data and adjusting the columns to the proper format in their SI unit. 2. After preprocessing the dataset and addressing outliers, we calculate the monthly mean wind speeds for each airport. 3. Subsequently, we visualize the monthly mean wind speeds for all three airports on a single plot, providing insights into wind speed variations over time.\nThe analysis aims to provide valuable information for stakeholders involved in aviation, urban planning, and renewable energy sectors."

While all three airports experience fluctuations in wind speeds throughout the year, certain months exhibit higher wind speeds compared to others.\nBy identifying and visualizing these trends, stakeholders can better understand the wind climate at each airport and make informed decisions regarding infrastructure development, flight operations, and energy generation projects. Additionally, the identification and handling of outliers ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis results.\nMoving forward, further research could explore the impact of wind speed variations on specific sectors and evaluate potential mitigation strategies for adverse"

These datasets contained various information related to Acculturation, Audiometry data, demographic details, blood pressure examination, and body measures, respectively.\nTo ensure data quality, we performed two key data preparation steps.\nFirstly, we removed columns with more than 25% null values from each dataframe, ensuring that we retained only relevant and informative features.\nSecondly, we eliminated any duplicate rows within each dataframe to prevent redundancy and maintain data integrity.\nAfter completing the data preparation steps for each individual dataframe, we merged them based on a common identifier, the ‚ÄúSEQN‚Äù column. This facilitated the creation of a comprehensive dataset containing consolidated information from all five datasets.\nThe resulting merged dataframe, named merged_df, provides a unified view of the data, enabling further analysis and exploration of relationships between different variables across the datasets. This consolidated dataset serves as a valuable resource for gaining insights and making informed decisions in subsequent data analysis tasks.\n\n# Read P_ACQ.XPT into a dataframe\ndf_acq = pd.read_sas('P_ACQ.XPT', format='xport')\n\n# Read P_AUX.XPT into a dataframe\ndf_aux = pd.read_sas('P_AUX.XPT', format='xport')\n\n# Read P_DEMO.XPT into a dataframe\ndf_demo = pd.read_sas('P_DEMO.XPT', format='xport')\n\n# Read P_BPXO.XPT into a dataframe\ndf_bpxo = pd.read_sas('P_BPXO.XPT', format='xport')\n\n# Read P_BMX.XPT into a dataframe\ndf_bmx = pd.read_sas('P_BMX.XPT', format='xport')\n\n\n# List of dataframes\ndfs = [df_acq, df_aux, df_demo, df_bpxo, df_bmx]\n\n# Remove columns with &gt; 25% null values and remove duplicated rows\nfor df in dfs:\n    # Remove columns with &gt; 25% null values\n    df.dropna(thresh=len(df) * 0.75, axis=1, inplace=True)\n    # Remove duplicated rows\n    df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)\n\n# Merge dataframes on \"SEQN\" column\nmerged_df = pd.merge(df_acq, df_aux, on='SEQN', how='inner')\nmerged_df = pd.merge(merged_df, df_demo, on='SEQN', how='inner')\nmerged_df = pd.merge(merged_df, df_bpxo, on='SEQN', how='inner')\nmerged_df = pd.merge(merged_df, df_bmx, on='SEQN', how='inner')"

dataframe merged_df in order to focus on creating visualizations for these columns in the subsequent sections.\n\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n\n# Copy the dataframe to avoid modifying the original dataframe\ndf_encoded = merged_df.copy()\n\n# Initialize LabelEncoder\nlabel_encoder = LabelEncoder()\n\n# Encode string columns\nfor column in df_encoded.columns:\n    if df_encoded[column].dtype == 'object':\n        df_encoded[column] = label_encoder.fit_transform(df_encoded[column].astype(str))\n\n# Compute correlation matrix\ncorrelation_matrix = df_encoded.corr()\n\n# Get the absolute correlation values for each column\ncorrelation_values = correlation_matrix.abs()\n\n# Get the columns with the highest correlation values\n# We exclude the diagonal and duplicate entries by masking them with a boolean mask\n# Here, we choose the top 10 correlated columns, you can adjust this number as needed\ntop_correlated_columns = (correlation_values.mask(~np.tri(*correlation_values.shape, k=-1, dtype=bool))\n                          .stack()\n                          .sort_values(ascending=False)\n                          .head(10)\n                          .reset_index())\n\n# Rename columns for clarity\ntop_correlated_columns.columns = ['Column 1', 'Column 2', 'Correlation Value']\n\n# Display the top correlated columns\nprint(top_correlated_columns)\n\n   Column 1  Column 2  Correlation Value\n0  AUXU1K2R  AUXU1K1R           0.999666\n1  AUXU1K2L  AUXU1K1L           0.997321\n2  WTMECPRP  WTINTPRP

module to encode string columns within the dataframe. This is essential as string columns cannot be directly used to compute correlations. By encoding them into numerical values, the data becomes suitable for correlation analysis.\nA for loop iterates through each column in the dataframe, and if the column‚Äôs data type is ‚Äòobject‚Äô (indicating it is a string column), it is encoded using the LabelEncoder.\nNext, the code computes the correlation matrix for the encoded dataframe, followed by extracting the absolute correlation values for each column pair.\nTo select the top correlated columns, the code employs a boolean mask to exclude the diagonal and duplicate entries in the correlation matrix. This ensures that each column is only compared with others, and not with itself or duplicates.\nFinally, the top correlated column pairs along with their correlation values are printed to the console. This information will guide the subsequent visualization process, focusing on the most informative relationships within the data. Adjustments can be made to the number of top correlated columns considered for visualization as needed.\n\n\n\nInteractive Visualizations from Merged DataFrame\nThis subheading introduces a section of code that creates interactive visualizations using the Bokeh package. The code is designed to work with a DataFrame called merged_df containing data, and it aims to provide a visual exploration of selected columns.\n\nbokeh.io.output_notebook(INLINE)\n\n    \n    \n        \n        Loading BokehJS ...\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Output to notebook\noutput_notebook()\n\n# Select only the columns from the top correlated pairs\nselected_columns = ['AUXU1K2R', 'AUXU1K1R', 'AUXU1K2L', 'AUXU1K1L', 'WTMECPRP', 'WTINTPRP',\n                    'AUXROEXC', 'AUXROTSP', 'RIDRETH3', 'RIDRETH1', 'AUXLOEXC', 'AUXOTSPL']\n\n# Create a copy of the DataFrame to avoid the SettingWithCopyWarning\ndf_subset = merged_df[selected_columns].copy()\n\n# Drop rows with NaN values from the copied DataFrame\ndf_subset.dropna(inplace=True)\n\n# Convert DataFrame to ColumnDataSource\nsource = ColumnDataSource(df_subset)\n\n# Scatter plot\nscatter = figure(title=\"Scatter Plot\", x_axis_label='AUXU1K2R', y_axis_label='AUXU1K1R')\nscatter.circle('AUXU1K2R', 'AUXU1K1R', size=10, source=source, color='navy', legend_label='Correlation Value')\nscatter_hover = HoverTool(tooltips=[(\"AUXU1K2R\", \"@AUXU1K2R\"), (\"AUXU1K1R\", \"@AUXU1K1R\")])\nscatter.add_tools(scatter_hover)\n\n# Line plot\nline = figure(title=\"Line Plot\", x_axis_label='WTMECPRP', y_axis_label='WTINTPRP')\nline.line('WTMECPRP', 'WTINTPRP', source=source, line_width=2, line_color=\"orange\")\n\n# Convert numerical values to strings\nx_values = [str(value) for value in df_subset['AUXROEXC'].unique()]\n\n# Bar plot\nbar = figure(title=\"Bar Plot\", x_range=x_values, x_axis_label='AUXROEXC', y_axis_label='AUXROTSP')\nbar.vbar(x='AUXROEXC', top='AUXROTSP', width=0.5, source=source, color='navy', legend_label='AUXROTSP')\nbar.xaxis.major_label_orientation = 1.2\n\n# Convert numerical values to strings\nx_values = [str(value) for value in df_subset['RIDRETH3'].unique()]\ny_values = [str(value) for value in df_subset['RIDRETH1'].unique()]\n\n# Heatmap\nheatmap = figure(title=\"Heatmap\", x_range=x_values, y_range=y_values,\n                 x_axis_label='RIDRETH3', y_axis_label='RIDRETH1')\nheatmap.rect(x='RIDRETH3', y='RIDRETH1', width=1, height=1, source=source,\n             fill_color='blue', line_color=None)\nheatmap.xaxis.major_label_orientation = 1.2\n\n# Stacked bar chart\nstacked_bar = figure(title=\"Stacked Bar Chart\", x_range=x_values, x_axis_label='RIDRETH3', y_axis_label='AUXU1K1R')\nstacked_bar.vbar_stack(stackers=selected_columns[:2], x='RIDRETH3', width=0.5, color=['blue', 'orange'], source=source,\n                       legend_label=['AUXU1K2R', 'AUXU1K1R'])\n\n# Slider for controlling circle size in scatter plot\nslider_circle_size = Slider(start=1, end=20, value=10, step=1, title=\"Circle Size\")\n\n# JavaScript callback to update circle size\ncallback_update_circle_size = CustomJS(args=dict(circle=scatter), code=\"\"\"\n    circle.glyph.size = cb_obj.value;\n\"\"\")\nslider_circle_size.js_on_change('value', callback_update_circle_size)\n\n# Slider for controlling line width in line plot\nslider_line_width = Slider(start=1, end=5, value=2, step=0.5, title=\"Line Width\")\n\n# JavaScript callback to update line width\ncallback_update_line_width = CustomJS(args=dict(line=line), code=\"\"\"\n    line.glyph.line_width = cb_obj.value;\n\"\"\")\nslider_line_width.js_on_change('value', callback_update_line_width)\n\n# Text input for filtering bar plot\ntext_input_filter = TextInput(value='', title='Filter Bar Plot')\n\n# JavaScript callback to filter bar plot\ncallback_filter_bar = CustomJS(args=dict(source=source, bar=bar), code=\"\"\"\n    var data = source.data;\n    var filterValue = cb_obj.value.toLowerCase().trim();

It drops any rows with missing values to ensure data integrity.\nConvert to ColumnDataSource: Converts the subset DataFrame (df_subset) into a ColumnDataSource object (source), which is a requirement for creating Bokeh plots.\nCreate Visualizations:\n\nScatter Plot: Plots the relationship between ‚ÄòAUXU1K2R‚Äô and ‚ÄòAUXU1K1R‚Äô columns.\nLine Plot: Shows the trend between ‚ÄòWTMECPRP‚Äô and ‚ÄòWTINTPRP‚Äô columns.\nBar Plot: Displays the distribution of ‚ÄòAUXROTSP‚Äô values across different levels of ‚ÄòAUXROEXC‚Äô.\nHeatmap: Represents the relationship between ‚ÄòRIDRETH3‚Äô and ‚ÄòRIDRETH1‚Äô columns using color intensity.\nStacked Bar Chart: Illustrates the comparison between ‚ÄòAUXU1K2R‚Äô and ‚ÄòAUXU1K1R‚Äô across various levels of ‚ÄòRIDRETH3‚Äô.\nData Table: Provides a tabular view of the selected columns for reference.\n\nCombine Plots: Organizes the visualizations and the data table into a grid layout using gridplot.\nShow the Result: Renders the layout to the specified output file, enabling interaction with the visualizations in a web browser.\n\nThis section of code facilitates the exploration and analysis of the data by providing interactive visualizations that allow for deeper insights into the relationships and distributions within the dataset.\n\n\n\nInsights and Reflections\n\nInsights:\n\nScatter Plot Analysis: The scatter plot reveals a strong positive correlation between ‚ÄòAUXU1K2R‚Äô and ‚ÄòAUXU1K1R‚Äô. This suggests that there is a linear relationship between these two variables, indicating that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well.\nLine Plot Observation: The line plot shows a consistent trend between ‚ÄòWTMECPRP‚Äô and ‚ÄòWTINTPRP‚Äô, indicating a stable relationship between the two variables over time.\nBar Plot Interpretation: The bar plot demonstrates the distribution of ‚ÄòAUXROTSP‚Äô values across different categories of ‚ÄòAUXROEXC‚Äô. It highlights potential variations in ‚ÄòAUXROTSP‚Äô based on the levels of ‚ÄòAUXROEXC‚Äô, providing insights into potential factors influencing ‚ÄòAUXROTSP‚Äô.\nHeatmap Exploration: The heatmap visualizes the relationship between ‚ÄòRIDRETH3‚Äô and ‚ÄòRIDRETH1‚Äô, showcasing potential patterns or clusters within the data. It allows for the identification of any trends or disparities across different demographic groups.\nStacked Bar Chart Insight: The stacked bar chart provides a comparison of ‚ÄòAUXU1K2R‚Äô and ‚ÄòAUXU1K1R‚Äô across various levels of ‚ÄòRIDRETH3‚Äô. It enables the exploration of differences or similarities in the distribution of these variables within different demographic groups.\n\n\n\nReflections on Privacy and Ethics:\n\nData Privacy Concerns: While analyzing and visualizing data, it‚Äôs crucial to ensure the protection of individuals‚Äô privacy. Even though the dataset may be anonymized, the insights gained from the analysis could potentially lead to re-identification of individuals, especially in sensitive demographic variables like race or ethnicity (‚ÄòRIDRETH3‚Äô and ‚ÄòRIDRETH1‚Äô). Care must be taken to avoid unintentional disclosure of sensitive information.\nEthical Considerations: Ethical issues may arise when interpreting and communicating the results of data analysis. It‚Äôs essential to present findings accurately and responsibly, avoiding any biased interpretations or misrepresentations. Additionally, decisions based on data analysis should prioritize fairness and equity to avoid perpetuating existing inequalities or biases present in the data.\nInformed Consent: If the data used for analysis contains personally identifiable information, obtaining informed consent from the individuals involved is crucial. Individuals should be informed about how their data will be used and have the option to opt-out if they wish to protect their privacy.\nData Security: Ensuring the security of the data throughout the analysis process is paramount. Measures such as encryption, access controls, and secure data storage should be implemented to prevent unauthorized access or data breaches.\nTransparency and Accountability: Transparency in data analysis practices, including documentation of methodologies and assumptions, fosters accountability and trust. Researchers should be transparent about the sources of data, analytical techniques employed, and any limitations or biases present in the data.\n\nIn conclusion, while data analysis provides valuable insights, it‚Äôs essential to approach it ethically and responsibly, considering the potential privacy implications and ensuring that the rights and dignity of individuals are respected throughout the process."

Then, the agg() function is used to specify the aggregation functions for the year column, including ‚Äòmin‚Äô, ‚Äòmean‚Äô, and ‚Äòmax‚Äô. The result is stored in a new DataFrame with the specified column names for the aggregated values.\nColumn Reordering and Renaming: After computing the aggregated statistics, the columns in the pandas DataFrame are reordered to match the desired order of ‚ÄúMIN(year)‚Äù, ‚ÄúAVG(year)‚Äù, ‚ÄúMAX(year)‚Äù, ‚Äúengine‚Äù, and ‚Äúmanufacturer‚Äù.

The resulting DataFrame‚Äôs index is reset to ensure consistency.\nFinally, the code compares the results obtained from pandas with those from the SQL query using pd.testing.assert_frame_equal() to ensure their equivalence.\n\n\n\nFiltering Planes by Seat Capacity and Year\nThe code aims to retrieve the tail numbers (‚Äòtailnum‚Äô) of planes from a dataset where the seat capacity (‚Äòseats‚Äô) falls within the range of 150 to 210 and the manufacturing year (‚Äòyear‚Äô) is greater than or equal to 2011.\n\n# Selecting 'tailnum' from planes_df where 'seats' are between 150 and 210 and 'year' is greater than or equal to 2011\ntask_sql_filtered_planes = pd.read_sql_query(\"\"\"\n    SELECT tailnum FROM planes\n    WHERE seats BETWEEN 150 AND 210 AND year &gt;= 2011;\n\"\"\", conn)\n\n# Pandas equivalent\ntask_my_filtered_planes = planes_df[(planes_df['seats'].between(150, 210)) & (planes_df['year'] &gt;= 2011)][['tailnum']].reset_index(drop=True)\n\n# Check if the results match with the SQL query\nif pd.testing.assert_frame_equal(task_sql_filtered_planes, task_my_filtered_planes) is None:\n    print(\"Results match with the SQL query!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Results do not match with the SQL query.\")\n\nResults match with the SQL query!\n\n\nSummary:\n\nThe SQL query selects the ‚Äòtailnum‚Äô column from the ‚Äúplanes‚Äù table where the ‚Äòseats‚Äô column falls within the range of 150 to 210 and the ‚Äòyear‚Äô column is greater than or equal to 2011.\nThe pandas equivalent achieves the same result by applying boolean indexing to the planes_df DataFrame. It filters rows where the ‚Äòseats‚Äô column falls within the specified range and where the ‚Äòyear‚Äô column is greater than or equal to 2011. Only the ‚Äòtailnum‚Äô column is selected in the resulting DataFrame, and the index is reset for consistency.\nFinally, the code compares the results obtained from pandas with those from the SQL query using pd.testing.assert_frame_equal() to ensure their equivalence.\n\nThis code snippet demonstrates how to filter rows based on multiple conditions, both in SQL and pandas, and verifies that the results match.\n\n\nFiltering Planes by Manufacturer and Seat Capacity\nThe code aims to retrieve specific information about planes from a dataset, including the tail number (‚Äòtailnum‚Äô), manufacturer, and seat capacity (‚Äòseats‚Äô).

It also verifies that the results obtained from pandas match those from the SQL query.\n\n\nTop 10 Manufacturers by Plane Count\nThe code aims to identify the top 10 manufacturers based on the count of planes they have produced.\n\n# Performing group by on 'manufacturer', counting the occurrences, and sorting in descending order\ntask_sql_top_manufacturers = pd.read_sql_query(\"\"\"\n    SELECT manufacturer, COUNT(*) AS howmany \n    FROM planes\n    GROUP BY manufacturer\n    ORDER BY howmany DESC LIMIT 10;\n\"\"\", conn)\n\n# Pandas equivalent\nmanufacturer_counts = planes_df.groupby('manufacturer').size().reset_index(name='howmany')\ntask_my_top_manufacturers = manufacturer_counts.sort_values(by='howmany', ascending=False).head(10).reset_index(drop=True)\n\n# Check if the results match with the SQL query\nif pd.testing.assert_frame_equal(task_sql_top_manufacturers, task_my_top_manufacturers) is None:\n    print(\"Results match with the SQL query!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Results do not match with the SQL query.\")\n\nResults match with the SQL query!\n\n\nSummary: - The SQL query groups the planes by ‚Äòmanufacturer‚Äô, counts the occurrences for each group, and sorts the results in descending order of count. It then selects the top 10 manufacturers based on this count. - The pandas equivalent achieves the same result by first performing a group by on the ‚Äòmanufacturer‚Äô column and calculating the size of each group to get the count of planes for each manufacturer. The count column is renamed to ‚Äòhowmany‚Äô. Then, it sorts the DataFrame in descending order of the count and selects the top 10 rows. The index is reset for consistency. - Finally, the code compares the results obtained from pandas with those from the SQL query using pd.testing.assert_frame_equal() to ensure their equivalence.\nThis code snippet demonstrates how to find the top 10 manufacturers by plane count using both SQL and pandas. It also verifies that the results obtained from pandas match those from the SQL query.\n\n\nMerging Flights Data with Plane Information\nThe code aims to combine information from the flights table with additional data about planes, including year, speed, and seats, obtained from the planes table.\n\n# SQL Query\ntask_sql_flights_planes = pd.read_sql_query(\"\"\"\n    SELECT\n        flights.*,\n        planes.year AS plane_year,\n        planes.speed AS plane_speed,\n        planes.seats AS plane_seats\n    FROM flights\n    LEFT JOIN planes ON flights.tailnum=planes.tailnum;\n\"\"\", conn)\n\n# Pandas Equivalent\nplanes_subset = planes_df[['tailnum', 'year', 'speed', 'seats']].copy()\nplanes_subset.columns = ['tailnum', 'plane_year', 'plane_speed', 'plane_seats']\ntask1_my_flights_planes = pd.merge(flights_df, planes_subset, on='tailnum', how='left')\n\n# Check if the results match with the SQL query\nif pd.testing.assert_frame_equal(task_sql_flights_planes, task1_my_flights_planes) is None:\n    print(\"Results match with the SQL query!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Results do not match with the SQL query.\")\n\nResults match with the SQL query!\n\n\nSummary: - SQL Query: The SQL query selects all columns from the ‚Äòflights‚Äô table and adds columns for ‚Äòyear‚Äô, ‚Äòspeed‚Äô, and ‚Äòseats‚Äô from the ‚Äòplanes‚Äô table using a LEFT JOIN operation. - Pandas Equivalent: The pandas equivalent first creates a subset of columns from the ‚Äòplanes_df‚Äô DataFrame, including ‚Äòtailnum‚Äô, ‚Äòyear‚Äô, ‚Äòspeed‚Äô, and ‚Äòseats‚Äô. The column names are then renamed to match those specified in the SQL query. This subset is merged with the ‚Äòflights_df‚Äô DataFrame based on the common column ‚Äòtailnum‚Äô, using a left join operation. - The code then compares the results obtained from pandas with those from the SQL query using pd.testing.assert_frame_equal() to ensure their equivalence.\nThis code snippet demonstrates how to merge data from two tables using both SQL and pandas, and it verifies that the results obtained from pandas match those from the SQL query.\n\n\nMerging Plane and Airline Data\nThe code aims to combine information from the planes and airlines tables using data from the flights table as a bridge. Additionally, it reorders the columns in the merged DataFrame to match a specified order.\n\n# SQL Query\ntask_sql_planes_airlines = pd.read_sql_query(\"\"\"\n    SELECT planes.*, airlines.* FROM\n    (SELECT DISTINCT carrier, tailnum FROM flights) AS cartail\n    INNER JOIN planes ON cartail.tailnum=planes.tailnum\n    INNER JOIN airlines ON cartail.carrier=airlines.carrier;\n\"\"\", conn)\n\n# Pandas Equivalent\ncartail = flights_df[['carrier', 'tailnum']].drop_duplicates()\nmerged_data = pd.merge(cartail, planes_df, on='tailnum', how='inner')\ntask_my_planes_airlines = pd.merge(merged_data, airlines_df, on='carrier', how='inner')\n\n# Sorting by tailnum\ntask_my_planes_airlines = task_my_planes_airlines.sort_values(by=['tailnum', 'carrier']).reset_index(drop=True)\n\n# Reordering columns in task_my_planes_airlines DataFrame\ntask_my_planes_airlines = task_my_planes_airlines[['tailnum', 'year', 'type', 'manufacturer', 'model', 'engines', 'seats', 'speed', 'engine', 'carrier', 'name']]\n\n# Check if the results match with the SQL query\nif pd.testing.assert_frame_equal(task_sql_planes_airlines, task_my_planes_airlines) is None:\n    print(\"Results match with the SQL query!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Results do not match with the SQL query.\")\n\nResults match with the SQL query!\n\n\nSummary:\n\nSQL Query: The SQL query selects all columns from the ‚Äòplanes‚Äô and ‚Äòairlines‚Äô tables, inner joining them with a subquery that selects distinct combinations of ‚Äòcarrier‚Äô and ‚Äòtailnum‚Äô from the ‚Äòflights‚Äô table. The join conditions ensure that ‚Äòtailnum‚Äô matches between ‚Äòcartail‚Äô (the result of the subquery) and ‚Äòplanes‚Äô, and ‚Äòcarrier‚Äô matches between ‚Äòcartail‚Äô and ‚Äòairlines‚Äô.\nPandas Equivalent: The pandas equivalent first creates a subset of unique combinations of ‚Äòcarrier‚Äô and ‚Äòtailnum‚Äô from the ‚Äòflights_df‚Äô DataFrame. This subset is merged with the ‚Äòplanes_df‚Äô DataFrame based on ‚Äòtailnum‚Äô and then with the ‚Äòairlines_df‚Äô DataFrame based on ‚Äòcarrier‚Äô. The resulting DataFrame is sorted by ‚Äòtailnum‚Äô and ‚Äòcarrier‚Äô. Finally, the columns are reordered to match the specified order.\nThe code then compares the results obtained from pandas with those from the SQL query using pd.testing.assert_frame_equal() to ensure their equivalence.\n\nThis code snippet demonstrates how to merge data from multiple tables using both SQL and pandas, reorder the columns in the resulting DataFrame, and verify the equivalence of results obtained from pandas and SQL queries.\n\n\nMerging Flight and Weather Data for EWR Airport\nThe purpose of this code is to combine flight information from the flights table with weather data from the weather table for flights originating from EWR airport, and calculating the mean temperature and humidity, and finally comparing the results from the SQL dataframe and pandas dataframe.\n\n# SQL Query\ntask_sql_flight_weather = pd.read_sql_query(\"\"\"\n    SELECT flights2.*, atemp, ahumid\n    FROM (\n        SELECT * FROM flights WHERE origin='EWR'\n    ) AS flights2 \n    LEFT JOIN (\n        SELECT year, month, day, AVG(temp) AS atemp, AVG(humid) AS ahumid\n        FROM weather\n        WHERE origin='EWR'\n        GROUP BY year, month, day\n    ) AS weather2\n    ON flights2.year=weather2.year AND flights2.month=weather2.month AND flights2.day=weather2.day\n\"\"\", conn)\n\n# Pandas Equivalent with column renaming\newr_flights = flights_df[flights_df['origin'] == 'EWR'].copy()\nweather_ewr = weather_df[weather_df['origin'] == 'EWR'].groupby(['year', 'month', 'day']).agg({'temp': 'mean', 'humid': 'mean'}).reset_index()\nweather_ewr.rename(columns={'temp': 'atemp', 'humid': 'ahumid'}, inplace=True)  # Rename columns\nmerged_data = pd.merge(ewr_flights, weather_ewr, on=['year', 'month', 'day'], how='left')\n\n# Check if the results match with the SQL query\nif pd.testing.assert_frame_equal(task_sql_flight_weather, merged_data) is None:\n    print(\"Results match with the SQL query!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Results do not match with the SQL query.\")\n\nResults match with the SQL query!\n\n\nSummary:\n\nSQL Query: The SQL query selects flight data for flights originating from EWR and left joins it with aggregated weather data for EWR airport, averaging temperature and humidity values by year, month, and day. The resulting columns are named ‚Äòatemp‚Äô and ‚Äòahumid‚Äô.\nPandas Equivalent with Column Renaming: In the pandas equivalent, flights and weather data are filtered for EWR airport, and the temperature and humidity columns are averaged by year, month, and day. These columns are then renamed to ‚Äòatemp‚Äô and ‚Äòahumid‚Äô, respectively, using the rename() method. The dataframes are merged based on year, month, and day using a left join operation.\nThe code then compares the results obtained from pandas with those from the SQL query using pd.testing.assert_frame_equal() to ensure their equivalence.\n\nThis code snippet demonstrates how to merge flight and weather data using pandas, specifically for flights originating from EWR airport, while renaming the columns, and it verifies the equivalence of results obtained from pandas and SQL queries.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe translation of SQL queries to pandas DataFrame operations provides valuable insights into pandas‚Äô effectiveness in data manipulation tasks. By ensuring equivalence between SQL and pandas results, we validate pandas as a robust tool for data analysis, offering flexibility and ease of use comparable to traditional SQL queries. This project underscores the importance of understanding pandas‚Äô capabilities for proficient data analysis and reinforces its role as a powerful tool in the data science toolkit."

    "section": "Data Preparation",
    "text": "Data Preparation\nTo To begin, let‚Äôs import the necessary libraries, numpy in this case, and then use numpy.genfromtxt to read the CSV files into numpy matrices named male and female.\n\nnhanes_adult_male_bmx_2020.csv and nhanes_adult_female_bmx_2020.csv\n\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt # We import matplotlib to generate bar plots\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import skew\nfrom scipy.stats import spearmanr\n\n\n# Read the CSV files into numpy matrices\nmale = np.genfromtxt('nhanes_adult_male_bmx_2020.csv', delimiter=',')\nfemale = np.genfromtxt('nhanes_adult_female_bmx_2020.csv', delimiter=',')\n\n\nmale.shape\n\n(4082, 7)\n\n\nEach matrix represents the data for adult males and females, respectively, with seven columns as described: 1. weight(kg), 2. standing height(cm), 3. upper arm length(cm), 4. upper leg length(cm), 4. arm circumference(cm), 6. hip circumference(cm), and 7. waist circumference(cm).\nThese matrices will serve as the foundation for our further analysis\n\nCalculating and Adding Body Mass Index (BMI)\nIn this section, we compute the BMI for each participant based on their weight and standing height, and then augment the matrices with an eighth column to store these BMI values.\nTo calculate the body mass index (BMI) for each participant, we can use the formula:\n\\[\nBMI = \\frac{{\\text{{weight}}}}{{(\\text{{standing height}} / 100)^2}}\n\\]\nWe‚Äôll calculate the BMI for both male and female participants and add an eighth column to each matrix to store these values.\n\n# Calculate BMI for males and add as the eighth column\nmale_bmi = male[:, 0] / (male[:, 1] / 100)**2\nmale = np.column_stack((male, male_bmi))\n\n# Calculate BMI for females and add as the eighth column\nfemale_bmi = female[:, 0] / (female[:, 1] / 100)**2\nfemale = np.column_stack((female, female_bmi))\n\n\nmale[1], female[1], male.shape, female.shape\n\n(array([ 98.8       , 182.3       ,  42.        ,  40.1       ,\n         38.2       , 108.2       , 120.4       ,  29.72922633]),\n array([ 97.1       , 160.2       ,  34.7       ,  40.8       ,\n         35.8       , 126.1       , 117.9       ,  37.83504078]),\n (4082, 8),\n (4222, 8))\n\n\nNow, the male and female matrices have been updated to include an eighth column storing the BMI values for each participant. We can proceed with further analysis or visualization using these augmented data.\n\n\nVisualizing BMI Distribution by Gender\nThis section illustrates the distribution of BMI values for adult males and females through histograms. The code utilizes matplotlib to create two subplots within a single figure, each displaying the BMI distribution for males and females, respectively.\n\n# Create a figure and two subplots\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(8, 6))\n\n# Plot histogram for male BMIs\naxs[0].hist(male[:, 7], bins=20, color='blue', alpha=0.7)\naxs[0].set_title('Male BMI Distribution')\naxs[0].set_xlabel('BMI')\naxs[0].set_ylabel('Frequency')\n\n# Plot histogram for female BMIs\naxs[1].hist(female[:, 7], bins=20, color='magenta', alpha=0.7)\naxs[1].set_title('Female BMI Distribution')\naxs[1].set_xlabel('BMI')\naxs[1].set_ylabel('Frequency')\n\n# Calculate appropriate x-axis limits\nmin_bmi = min(np.nanmin(male[:, 7]), np.nanmin(female[:, 7]))\nmax_bmi = max(np.nanmax(male[:, 7]), np.nanmax(female[:, 7]))\n\n# Set x-axis limits to be the same for both subplots\nif not np.isnan(min_bmi) and not np.isnan(max_bmi):\n    plt.xlim(min_bmi, max_bmi)\n\n# Adjust layout to prevent overlap\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nTo create a single plot with two histograms, one for male BMIs and the other for female BMIs, we used matplotlib.pyplot.subplot to create two subplots in one figure. - We also set the number of histogram bins to 20 for each subplot and ensure that the x-axis limits are identical for both subfigures. - We use np.nanmin() and np.nanmax() functions to calculate the minimum and maximum BMI values, respectively, while ignoring NaN value. - Finally, we use plt.tight_layout() to adjust the layout to prevent overlap of labels and titles, and then display the plot using plt.show().\n\n\nComparing BMI Distributions between Genders\nThis section visualizes the distribution of BMI values for adult males and females through a box-and-whisker plot. The code utilizes matplotlib‚Äôs boxplot function to generate a comparative visualization, allowing for a straightforward comparison between the two genders.\n\n# Remove NaN values from male and female BMI data\nmale_bmi_clean = male[~np.isnan(male[:, 7]), 7]\nfemale_bmi_clean = female[~np.isnan(female[:, 7]), 7]\n\n# Combine cleaned male and female BMI data into a list\nbmi_data = [male_bmi_clean, female_bmi_clean]\n\n# Create a horizontal box-and-whisker plot\nplt.boxplot(bmi_data, labels=['Male', 'Female'], vert=False)\n\n# Add title and labels\nplt.title('BMI Distribution by Gender')\nplt.xlabel('BMI')\nplt.ylabel('Gender')\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nWe removed NaN values from the BMI data before creating the box-and-whisker plot. If we would have provided the raw data without cleaning (i.e., without removing NaN values), it would have resulted in an incorrect or empty plot.\nWe observed that mean for male and female are almost identical, somewhere between 25-30.\nWe also observe that max values for both are identical too somewhere near 65-70 range.\nAll the statistical summary points are closeby for male and female. We can also get the exact data points\n\n\n\nSummary of BMI Distribution Aggregates\nThis section presents a comparative analysis of the basic numerical aggregates for male and female BMI distributions. Measures of location, dispersion, and shape are calculated and reported in a clear and readable format, providing insights into the characteristics of the BMI distributions for both genders.\n\n# Compute aggregates for male BMI\nmale_mean = np.mean(male_bmi_clean)\nmale_median = np.median(male_bmi_clean)\nmale_min = np.min(male_bmi_clean)\nmale_max = np.max(male_bmi_clean)\nmale_std = np.std(male_bmi_clean)\nmale_iqr = np.percentile(male_bmi_clean, 75) - np.percentile(male_bmi_clean, 25)\nmale_skew = skew(male_bmi_clean)\n\n# Compute aggregates for female BMI\nfemale_mean = np.mean(female_bmi_clean)\nfemale_median = np.median(female_bmi_clean)\nfemale_min = np.min(female_bmi_clean)\nfemale_max = np.max(female_bmi_clean)\nfemale_std = np.std(female_bmi_clean)\nfemale_iqr = np.percentile(female_bmi_clean, 75) - np.percentile(female_bmi_clean, 25)\nfemale_skew = skew(female_bmi_clean)\n\n# Report the aggregates\nprint(\"BMI Statistics:\\n\")\nprint(\"Female   Male\")\nprint(f\"{female_mean:.2f}  {male_mean:.2f}  Mean\")\nprint(f\"{female_median:.2f}  {male_median:.2f}  Median\")\nprint(f\"{female_min:.2f}  {male_min:.2f}  Min\")\nprint(f\"{female_max:.2f}  {male_max:.2f}  Max\")\nprint(f\"{female_std:.2f}   {male_std:.2f}   Std\")\nprint(f\"{female_iqr:.2f}  {male_iqr:.2f}   IQR\")\nprint(f\"{female_skew:.2f}   {male_skew:.2f}   Skewness\")\n\nBMI Statistics:\n\nFemale   Male\n30.10  29.14  Mean\n28.89  28.27  Median\n14.20  14.91  Min\n67.04  66.50  Max\n7.76   6.31   Std\n10.01  7.73   IQR\n0.92   0.97   Skewness\n\n\nBased on the results obtained from the above we can describe the distributions of BMI for adult males and females as follows:\n\nLocation (Measures of Central Tendency):\n\nThe mean BMI for males is slightly lower than that for females (29.14 vs.¬†30.10), indicating that, on average, females have a slightly higher BMI compared to males.\nSimilarly, the median BMI for females is slightly higher than that for males (28.89 vs.¬†28.27), suggesting that the distribution of BMI values for females is shifted slightly towards higher values compared to males.\n\nDispersion (Measures of Spread):\n\nThe standard deviation of BMI values for females is higher than that for males (7.76 vs.¬†6.31), indicating greater variability in BMI among females compared to males.\nThe interquartile range (IQR) for females is also higher than that for males (10.01 vs.¬†7.73), further supporting the notion of greater dispersion in BMI values among females.\n\nShape (Skewness):\n\nThe skewness of the BMI distribution for females is positive (0.92), indicating a right-skewed distribution where the tail of the distribution extends towards higher BMI values.\nIn contrast, the skewness of the BMI distribution for males is slightly negative (-0.97), suggesting a left-skewed distribution where the tail of the distribution extends towards lower BMI values.\n\n\nOverall, these results suggest that the distribution of BMI values for adult females tends to have slightly higher central tendency, greater variability, and a right-skewed shape compared to adult males. The higher mean, median, standard deviation, and interquartile range for females indicate a wider spread of BMI values and a tendency towards higher values, while the positive skewness suggests that there are more individuals with higher BMI values among females compared to males.\n\n\nScatterplot Matrix for Male Biometric Measurements\nThis section showcases the relationships between male heights, weights, waist circumferences, hip circumferences, and BMIs through a scatterplot matrix.

This suggests that individuals with higher weights tend to have larger hip and waist circumferences, as well as higher BMI values.\nOn the other hand, standing height demonstrates a low correlation with hip circumference and waist circumference. This implies that there is less of a linear relationship between standing height and hip/waist circumferences compared to weight. In other words, while there may be some association between standing height and hip/waist circumferences, it is not as strong or consistent as the relationship observed with weight.\nhip circumference and waist circumference are closely related with each other and also do BMI."

suggestion bigrams have more frequent occurences of indirect suggestion expressing phrases like ‚Äòwould like‚Äô, ‚Äòwould nice‚Äô, ‚Äòwould great‚Äô. These phrases contain an auxiliary verb followed by a verb or an adjective. We may think of extracting some useful feature based on these patterns. However, such constructs also appear in the non-suggestion sentences, as is apparent from the non-suggestion bigrams. Also, given the fact that we have oversampled the positive class to balance the data, it will not be a great idea to extract features based on these bigram patterns.  The statistical models cannot learn the syntactic structure of sentences on their own. But, neural networks can. As suggested in paper  [3] , we will use Part Of Speech (POS) embeddings to improve the syntactic structure learning by the deep learning models.\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt; Finally, let's see how the length of sentences are related to their labels.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n::: {.cell _kg_hide-input=‚Äòtrue‚Äô _uuid=‚Äòc80ddf190c5aa410b025d7914a316340af34d151‚Äô execution_count=17}\n# plot of sentence length against label\n\ndf = pd.concat([train, dev])\ndf['count_word'] = df['sentence'].apply(lambda x : len(x.split()))\n\nplt.figure(figsize = (12, 6))\nplt.suptitle(\"How is sentence length related to its label?\", fontsize = 15)\ncount_word = df['count_word'].astype(int)\ndf['count_word'].loc[df['count_word'] &gt; 100] = 100\nplt.plot()\nsns.violinplot(y = 'count_word', x = 'label', data = df, split = True, inner = \"quart\")\nplt.xlabel('Suggestion?', fontsize = 12)\nplt.ylabel('Number of words in a sentence', fontsize = 12)\nplt.title(\"Number of sentences with a given word length\", fontsize = 12)\nplt.show()\n\ndel(df)\ngc.collect()\n\n\n\n\n2100\n\n:::\n\n&lt;p&gt; It can be seen from the above plot that both suggestion and non-suggestion classes have similar frequency distribution of sentences having a given number of words, so it will be unwise to label a sentence as suggestion or non-suggestion based on the number of words in it.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\nAnother measure that can be checked for is the mean word length.

As is evident from the above analysis, the features related to the frequency of words may not be useful in this particular case. This may be very domain specific, since users on developers‚Äô forums are often very concise, less verbose and use more technical terms while writing all kind of sentences. Although, the ngram features too do not seem to differentiate between the sentences in the two classes very well, using these to learn syntactic structure of sentences may improve performances of our statistical models. We need not use these additional features, other than the word embeddings for sequence representation, with deep learning models since the neural networks can learn better feature representations on their own.\n\n::: {.cell _uuid=‚Äòcb411bd69aa55d40512ad4aff9c85e64cdf1036c‚Äô execution_count=19}\n# corpus containing all the sentences in train, development and test data\n\ncorpus = (pd.concat([train.iloc[:, 0:2], dev.iloc[:, 0:2], test.iloc[:, 0:2]])).sentence\nclean_corpus = corpus.apply(lambda x : clean(x))\n:::\n::: {.cell _uuid=‚Äòa00e0320c8c27eb91e8fcd160c4f97d7a286a9f4‚Äô execution_count=20}\n# tf-idf vectors with unigram features\n\nunigram_tfv = TfidfVectorizer(strip_accents = 'unicode', analyzer = 'word', ngram_range = (1,1),\n                              sublinear_tf = 1, stop_words = 'english')\nunigram_tfv.fit(clean_corpus)\n\ntrain_unigrams = unigram_tfv.transform(clean_corpus.iloc[:train.shape[0]])\ndev_unigrams = unigram_tfv.transform(clean_corpus.iloc[train.shape[0]:train.shape[0]+dev.shape[0]])\ntest_unigrams = unigram_tfv.transform(clean_corpus.iloc[train.shape[0]+dev.shape[0]:])\n:::\n::: {.cell _uuid=‚Äò72a05a6d63f95ace49dbf2aa21825984a1e2ce77‚Äô execution_count=21}\n# tf-idf vectors with bigram and trigram features\n\nbtgram_tfv = TfidfVectorizer(strip_accents = 'unicode', analyzer = 'word', ngram_range = (2,3),\n            sublinear_tf = 1, stop_words = 'english')\nbtgram_tfv.fit(clean_corpus)\n\ntrain_btgrams = btgram_tfv.transform(clean_corpus.iloc[:train.shape[0]])\ndev_btgrams = btgram_tfv.transform(clean_corpus.iloc[train.shape[0]:train.shape[0]+dev.shape[0]])\ntest_btgrams = btgram_tfv.transform(clean_corpus.iloc[train.shape[0]+dev.shape[0]:])\n:::\n::: {.cell _uuid=‚Äòf4d3b7ced16f1280ea7afdf8b554cefe8f1dc715‚Äô execution_count=22}\n# tf-idf vectors with char n-gram features\n\ncharngram_tfv = TfidfVectorizer(strip_accents = 'unicode', analyzer = 'char', ngram_range = (1,5),\n                sublinear_tf = 1, stop_words = 'english')\ncharngram_tfv.fit(clean_corpus)\n\ntrain_charngrams =  charngram_tfv.transform(clean_corpus.iloc[:train.shape[0]])\ndev_charngrams = charngram_tfv.transform(clean_corpus.iloc[train.shape[0]:train.shape[0]+dev.shape[0]])\ntest_charngrams = charngram_tfv.transform(clean_corpus.iloc[train.shape[0]+dev.shape[0]:])\n:::\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Evaluation Metrics&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt; We will use three different evaluation metrics : Precision score, Recall score and F1 score.

It occupies 16 bits (two bytes in modern computers) in computer memory. Read more here.\npipe.to(\"mps\") is used, if you‚Äôre working on a Mac machine with M1/M2 chip.\n\nWe use from_pretrained to create the pipeline and download the pretrained weights. We indicate that we want to use the fp16 (half-precision) version of the weights, and we tell diffusers to expect the weights in that format. This allows us to perform much faster inference with almost no discernible difference in quality.\n\n\nShow the code\n!!ls ~/.cache/huggingface/hub\n\n\n['\\x1b[1m\\x1b[36mmodels--CompVis--stable-diffusion-v1-4\\x1b[m\\x1b[m',\n 'version.txt',\n 'version_diffusers_cache.txt']\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\npipe.enable_attention_slicing()\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nprompt = \"a photograph of an astronaut riding a tiger\"\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\npipe(prompt).images[0]\n\n\n\n\n\nKeyboardInterrupt: \n\n\n\n\nShow the code\n_ = pipe(prompt, num_inference_steps=1)\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntorch.__version__\n\n\n'2.0.0'\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ntorch.has_mps\n\n\nTrue\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ndevice = \"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"mps\" if torch.has_mps else \"cpu\"\nif torch.has_mps:\n    pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(\"CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4\", revision=\"fp16\", torch_dtype=torch.float16, use_auth_token=True).to(device)\nelse:\n    pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(\"CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4\", use_auth_token=True).to(device)\n\n\n/Users/kashmkj/micromamba/envs/fastai/lib/python3.11/site-packages/transformers/models/clip/feature_extraction_clip.py:28: FutureWarning: The class CLIPFeatureExtractor is deprecated and will be removed in version 5 of Transformers.

    "section": "The StableDiffusion Pipeline..",
    "text": "The StableDiffusion Pipeline..\nStable Diffusion has something called a Pipeline[1]. If you‚Äôre familiar with fast.ai, this is similar to what we call as fastai learner. The pipeline basically contains all the models, processing, inferencing, etc. One can save the pipeline, into the huggingface cloud (also called Hub). Learn more about diffusion inference pipeline[2].\nOne just need to provide the pre-trained model as repo-id present in the huggingface repo or a path to directory containing pipeline weights, train further and generate images of your choice. You can also save your own pipeline to the hub, for other people to use.\nSegue\n[1]. Many Hugging Face libraries (along with other libraries such as scikit-learn) use the concept of a ‚Äúpipeline‚Äù to indicate a sequence of steps that when combined complete some task.\n[2]. Inference means, using the model to generate output (i.e., images here), as opposed to training (or fine-tuning) models using new data.\nHere, we will be using CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4 model to generate our image from the text prompt.\n\n\nCode\nmodel_id = \"CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4\"\npipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch_dtype)\npipe = pipe.to(device)\n\n\n\nWhat else did I try..\nFrom the limited yet somehow various articles I read, I tried running the pipeline by passing several different arguments to the StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(..) function. However, the above worked best for me. Some of the parameters I tried include:\npipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(\n    \"CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4\",\n    use_auth_token=True,\n    revision=\"fp16\", \n    torch_dtype=torch.float16,\n    safety_checker=None\n).to(torch.device(\"mps\"))\npipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(\n    \"CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4\",\n    use_auth_token=True,\n    safety_checker=None\n).to(torch.device(\"mps\"))\npipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(\n    \"CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4\",\n    use_auth_token=True\n).to(torch.device(\"mps\"))\nAll the above three resulted in taking ~35 minutes of executing pipeline to generate an image (Present as part of the next code cell). With a few trial-and-errors, I was able to bring down the time from 30 minutes to under 2 minutes\nIt is recommended at multiple places including the official huggingface docs, that if your GPU is not big enough to use pipe command, run pipe.enable_attention_slicing()\nAs described in the docs: &gt; When this option is enabled, the attention module will split the input tensor in slices, to compute attention in several steps. This is useful to save some memory in exchange for a small speed decrease.\nBUT WAITTT!! Running the above command before executing the pipe operation to generate image(s) resulted in a completely blacked-out image. I tried various prompts and seeds to generate an image, however, it wasn‚Äôt successful on my machine. Hence, I didn‚Äôt use this command. If anyone is successfully able to generate an image by enabling the attention slicing mechanism, pls feel free to provide me information on how did you achieve that :)\n\n\nCode\npipe.device\n\n\ndevice(type='mps', index=0)\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntorch.manual_seed(1024)\nprompt = [\"European interior design room\"]\nimages = pipe(prompt, num_images_per_prompt=1)[0]\n\n\n\n\n\nRuntimeError: MPS backend out of memory (MPS allocated: 8.29 GB, other allocations: 664.11 MB, max allowed: 9.07 GB). Tried to allocate 512.00 MB on private pool. Use PYTORCH_MPS_HIGH_WATERMARK_RATIO=0.0 to disable upper limit for memory allocations (may cause system failure).\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndisplay(images[0])\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see it took less than 3 minutes to generate the image. Albiet, the best I have reached so far is ~1:30 minutes when I had most of applications closed. I know, folks have been able to successfully generate images in under 30 seconds on Mac M1/M2 chips, but for me, this is the best as of today that I could achieve. In my opinion, this machine is the lowest verion of Macbook Air M2, hence, the trade-off. I will keep on updating this blog post as amd when I am able to optimise it further.\nHope the above walk-through helps someone who‚Äôs struggling to run stable diffusion pre-trained models on their Macbook machine.\nAhh and yes, don‚Äôt forget to upvote this blog if even a tiny ounce of it helped you in some progress, as they always say, an upvote a blog keeps the blogger happy and prompt :)"

The testing accuracy for both of these is same with the currrent optimisation, the training accuracy for SVC is slightly better than Random Forest.

The current columns were just a bunch of numerical numbers, which didn‚Äôt meant anything to the human eye. Hence, understanding what is the function of each column, will help the data scientist to logically infer which columns can be proved more useful than the other. 4.
